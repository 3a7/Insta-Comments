A simple program to increase your account activity by automatically commenting to different posts

In the comments file.. You can describe what your original instagram account does/share (like funny posts/memes or general information) in one line and in the same line put your original account beside the comment.. In that way, people will get access to your account easier and faster and you'll increase your followers/likes/views with real and active people


There is 3 files with the program:-
- accounts.txt                To put your instagram accounts used to post the comments
- comments.txt                Different comments you want to post (the program will choose a random comment on every post)
- hashtags_and_profiles.txt   Profiles and hashtags used to scrape the posts you want to comment to.
